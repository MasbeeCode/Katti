# R2
# The number S is called the mean of two numbers R1 and R2 if S is equal to (R1 + R2) / 2. 
# Mirkoâ€™s birthday present for Slavko was two integers R1 and R2. 
# Slavko promptly calculated their mean which also happened to be an integer but then lost R2! Help Slavko restore R2.

# Input
# The first and only line of input contains two integers R1 and S, both between -1000 and 1000.


# Input
input = input().split(" ")

# Calculate r2
rTwo = (int(input[1]) * 2) - int(input[0])

# Output
print(rTwo)
